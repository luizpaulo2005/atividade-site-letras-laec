          All my wolves, begin to howl <br />
          Wake me up, the time is now <br />
          Oh, can you hear the drumming? <br />
          Oh, there's a revolution coming
        </p>

        <p>
          Wide awake, the fever burns<br />
          Sweat it out, wait my turn <br />
          Can you hear the drumming?<br />
          There's a revolution coming<br />
          All this doubt is creepin'in<br />
          Inside out, I shed my skin<br />
          Can you hear the drumming? <br />
          There's a revolution coming
        </p>

        <p>
          I been waitin' all my life <br />
          To live, when I've only been dreaming<br />
          Get love when I've only been stealing <br />
          Can't let time keep passing me by<br />
          Run down what I've always been chasing<br />
          Black out every fear I've been facing
        </p>

        <p>
          All my wolves, begin to howl <br />
          Wake me up, the time is now <br />
          Oh, can you hear the drumming?<br />
          Oh, there's a revolution coming<br />
          Wild things that turn me on<br />
          Drag my dark into the dawn<br />
          Oh, can you hear the drumming?<br />
          Oh, there's a revolution coming
        </p>

        <p>
          Body aches, I'm bound in chains <br />
          Well there's a fire in my veins and<br />
          Can you hear the drumming?<br />
          There's a revolution coming<br />
          Like every king who lost a crown<br />
          And all those years are history now<br />
          Can you hear the drumming?<br />
          There's a revolution coming
        </p>

        <p>
          I been waitin' all my life<br />

          From the bottom, can't hold me down<br/>
          Hold me down<br/> 
          I'm rising up, up from the ground<br/>
          From the bottom, can't hold me down<br/>
